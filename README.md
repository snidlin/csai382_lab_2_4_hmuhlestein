# Ethics Reflection
There is some data which should be avoided when thinking about logging; from a security standpoint, logging user input can result in privilege escalation, especially if log output is used anywhere else in a system. However, considering the cleartext nature of logs, a password or user credentials should stay away from logs in all situations, lest system security becomes compromised.
Reproducibility makes it so the results of our data runs are not only verifiable, but incredibly consistent. When you stake your name on some kind of data, ensuring that your reputation does not take a hit due to lying, hiding information, or other unethical acts equally ensures that your usage of data is wise and ethical.
